# dev log

## Frontend (Version 1) - 1 week

### Nav Bar
05/10/2023 - I created the navigation bar which contains the logo for titanic fitness, the gradient for the background, the nav buttons. I also animated the buttons so that they grow on hover.
- Test 1: The animations are a bit weird where the nav bar buttons move together with the button that's being hovered over. Only one of the buttons should move. Over than that, the style is correct and the layout is perfect
