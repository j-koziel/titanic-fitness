# dev log

This is just a development log which I have to make as part of my school project :)

This is the format which I am using

Iteration

Feature
- tests


## Frontend (Version 1) - 1 week

### Nav Bar
05/10/2023 - I created the navigation bar which contains the logo for titanic fitness, the gradient for the background, the nav buttons. I also animated the buttons so that they grow on hover.
- Test 1: The animations are a bit weird where the nav bar buttons move together with the button that's being hovered over. Only one of the buttons should move. Over than that, the style is correct and the layout is perfect

### Pages

#### Home Page
- 05/10/2023 - Added the main home page image and resized it to match the design
    1. Having an issue where the image is a bit too big.... I think instead of making it fill part of the screen I'll make it just be the background.
